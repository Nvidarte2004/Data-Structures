# Tree Rotation Functions in C++

This project implements basic single rotation functions for binary trees, specifically useful for self-balancing trees like AVL trees. It includes both left and right rotation logic along with a sample main function to demonstrate their use.

## Overview

In self-balancing binary search trees, rotations are essential for maintaining balance after insertions and deletions. This repository provides:

- A `Treenode` structure representing nodes in a binary tree.
- Utility functions to calculate node height and update it.
- `leftrotation` and `Rightrotation` functions.
- A simple test case in the `main` function demonstrating left rotation.
- In-order traversal function to visualize the tree structure.
