### Overview
Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that iteratively traverses a list, compares adjacent elements,
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is fully sorted. Though
not efficient for large datasets, it serves as an excellent introduction to sorting algorithms due to its simplicity.

### How It Works
1. Begin at the start of the array.
2. Compare the current element with the next one.
3. If the current element is greater than the next, swap them.
4. Move to the next pair and repeat until the end of the array.
5. Repeat the above steps for the entire array until no swaps are needed.
   
### Example
Initial Array: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Sorted Array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

### When to Use Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is best used for small datasets or for educational purposes where understanding the fundamental
mechanics of sorting is more important than efficiency.
Recommended Use Cases:
- Teaching or learning sorting algorithms
- Sorting very small lists
Avoid for:
- Large datasets
- Performance-critical applications
